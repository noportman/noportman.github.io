## Objective
To examine how coastal wetlands versus urban coastlines impact eutrophication, particularly harmful algal blooms (HABs), using remote sensing techniques off the southwestern coast of Florida.


## Key Concepts

- **Eutrophication:** Nutrient enrichment in water bodies, leading to excessive algae growth.
- **Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs):** Especially *Karenia brevis* (red tide), producing toxins harmful to humans and marine ecosystems.
- **Remote Sensing:** Tools like MODIS-Aqua and Landsat 8 used to track chlorophyll concentrations (a proxy for eutrophication).


## Study Area

- **Location:** Gordon Pass between:
    - **Naples (urban coast)**
    - **Everglades (wetlands)**
- **Regions Analyzed (4km x 4km):**
    - **Region A:** Offshore Urban (North)
    - **Region B:** Gordon Pass (Middle / Control)
    - **Region C:** Offshore Wetlands (South)


## Methods

- **MODIS-Aqua:** 8-day chlorophyll-a data (2005â€“2020).
- **Landsat 8:** High-resolution (30m) imagery from 2014 & 2019, processed via Acolite and SeaDAS.
- **Anomaly Analysis:** Compared seasonal chlorophyll values to a 15-year baseline.
- **Ocean Currents:** Used to interpret HAB movement patterns.

## Key Findings

- **Seasonality:** Fall chlorophyll peaks observed consistently.
- **Bloom Year 2019:**
     - Region A (urban): Highest chlorophyll levels.
     - Region C (wetlands): Lowest levels.
     - 2014 was a lower bloom year.
- **Wetland Effectiveness:**
     - Region C had ~14% **less** chlorophyll than Region B.
     - Region A had ~16% **more** than Region B.
     - Wetlands likely help buffer nutrients and reduce HAB impact during extreme bloom events.

## Conclusions

- Coastal wetlands may act as **nutrient sinks**, reducing the intensity of harmful algal blooms.
- Urbanized coasts may contribute more nutrients, exacerbating eutrophication.
- Highlights the importance of **Everglades restoration efforts**, particularly around water quality management and wetland expansion.


## Reflections

- **Remote Sensing Tools:** Crucial for analyzing large-scale coastal changes. Landsat 8 was especially helpful for high-resolution analysis.
- **Biggest Challenge:** Defining spatial boundaries offshore that reflect true impacts without overlap or distortion.
- **What Could Be Improved:** Including more high-bloom and low-bloom years for a stronger statistical case.
- **Key Learning:** Accessing and applying remote sensing data (NASA, USGS) to develop and test scientific hypotheses confidently.
