### Objective
To assess particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations in NYC’s subway system using low-cost air sensors and determine whether they exceed EPA standards, with a focus on exposure risks for student commuters.


### Methods

- **Devices Used:**
  - **PurpleAir PA-II-SD**: Low-cost laser particle counter.
  - **UPAS**: Gravimetric filter-based sampler used for calibration.
  - **Temptop M2000C**: Nephelometer for real-time PM and CO₂ data.

- **Data Collection:**
  - 25+ subway ride events.
  - Locations: Manhattan, Staten Island, Brooklyn, Queens.
  - Two strategies: (a) extended station sampling, (b) full commute sampling.
  - Calibration done via UPAS filters and outdoor reference stations.


### Key Sites

- Subway lines: 1, F, L, 7, SIR, W, etc.
- Stations near schools: WHEELS (Manhattan), Curtis HS (Staten Island), West End Secondary.


### Key Findings

- **PM2.5 Concentrations:**
  - **Average subway PM2.5:** ~105 µg/m³
  - **NYC outdoor average:** ~6.55 µg/m³
  - **EPA 24-hour standard:** 35 µg/m³

- **Worst Stations:**
  - *2nd Ave (F line)*: 407.88 µg/m³
  - *Lexington Ave-63rd*: 113.19 µg/m³

- **Best Air Quality:**
  - *SIR* and *W trains* (mostly aboveground): < EPA thresholds

- **Commuter Exposure:**
  - 2-hour daily commute: 19% above daily EPA threshold
  - MTA workers (8 hrs underground): 246% above threshold

- **Train Car Behavior:**
  - PM drops during transit, rises at stops due to door opening


### Health Implications

- PM2.5 linked to respiratory and cardiovascular disease, especially in youth and elderly.
- Underground PM contains metals (Fe, Mn, Cr) more harmful than typical urban PM.
- Subway exposure could pose significant health risks over time.


### Limitations

- Only 4 PurpleAir sensors available.
- Temporal and spatial coverage limited.
- Lack of full chemical characterization of PM2.5.
- Calibration methods varied slightly for aboveground vs underground data.


### Recommendations

- Install a network of calibrated low-cost air quality sensors across the subway system.
- Conduct long-term air quality monitoring and integrate findings into public health alerts.
- Focus on **environmental justice**, identifying communities disproportionately affected by subway-related pollution.


### Future Directions

- Expand data collection to all subway lines and times of day.
- Apply similar monitoring in other indoor public spaces (e.g. schools, buses).
- Use findings to inform ventilation upgrades and policy changes in subway systems.
