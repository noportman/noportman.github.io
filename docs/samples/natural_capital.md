## Objective
To explore how rethinking **natural and human capital accounting** can inform fairer and more sustainable global carbon budget policies, highlighting the need for equitable climate action through better asset valuation and policy alignment.


## Key Concepts

- **Carbon Budget:** Global limit of 850–1550 GtCO₂ to stay below 2°C warming.
- **Natural Capital:** Earth’s stock of resources and ecosystems (e.g. air, water, land, biodiversity).
- **Human Capital:** Educated, healthy, skilled populations driving sustainable development.
- **Disparity:** Only a few of the 195 Paris Agreement signatories are on track to meet targets.

## Data & References

- **Reports Cited:**
    - World Bank’s *Changing Wealth of Nations 2018*
    - McKinsey Global Institute’s *Reduced Dividends on Natural Capital*
    - Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) from Morocco, Costa Rica, The Gambia
    - Climate Action Tracker (CAT)


## Capital Stock Analysis

- **Natural Capital undervalued** → exploited beyond replenishment (Tragedy of the Commons).
- **Accounting Frameworks:**
    - **EVA (Ecosystem Valuation & Accounting)** by Conservation International.
    - **SEEA (System of Environmental-Economic Accounting)** – harmonized with GDP.
- **World Bank Findings:**
    - Global wealth ↑ 66% from 1995–2014; human capital = 2/3 of global wealth.
    - Natural capital = 9% globally, but nearly 50% of low-income countries' wealth.

## Country Comparisons & Leadership

- **Top Performers:**
    - **Morocco:** 42–52% renewable energy by 2030; Noor solar plant = global model.
    - **The Gambia:** Massive forest restoration + solar PV expansion.
    - **Costa Rica:** 98% renewable electricity; moratorium on oil drilling.

- **Lagging Nations:** Developed countries with high historical emissions.


## Policy & Effort-Sharing Frameworks

- **Equity Principles Used for Carbon Budget Allocation:**
    - Grandfathering (GF)
    - Per Capita Convergence (PCC, IEPC)
    - Equal Cumulative Per Capita Emissions (ECPC)
    - Ability to Pay (AP)
    - Greenhouse Development Rights (GDR)
    - Cost-Optimal (CO)

- **Conclusion:** Equity-driven models often result in **negative budgets** for wealthy nations, implying the need for urgent and ambitious policy reform.


## Case Studies & Models

- **Three Gorges Reservoir (China):** Demonstrated negative decoupling between land use and sustainability; emphasized need for stronger ecological policies.
- **Zhang et al.:** Introduced a formula to measure sustainability via land capital utilization ratio (stock vs. flow).
- **van den Berg et al.:** Compared seven effort-sharing models; illustrated massive implications on fair carbon budget distribution.


## Recommendations

- Recognize **natural capital as core to wealth and development**.
- Encourage **mainstreaming** of natural capital accounting in government and business decisions.
- Use **Natural Capital Protocol** to help businesses balance growth with ecological impact.
- Invest globally in ecosystem services (e.g. coral insurance, mangrove protection).
- Pursue coordinated international response, particularly for climate-vulnerable regions.


## Conclusion

- Rethinking economic progress by incorporating **natural capital valuation** is critical.
- **Equity, transparency, and long-term vision** must guide global carbon budget negotiations.
- Collaborative leadership from both developed and developing countries is key to climate resilience.
