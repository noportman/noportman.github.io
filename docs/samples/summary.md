# :material-typewriter: Samples

## Overview
This collection of applied research projects spans air and water quality, climate policy, and ecological accounting. Through data-driven analysis, remote sensing, and policy evaluation, each study explores sustainable development challenges and proposes actionable solutions for decision-makers, urban planners, and environmental managers.

=== "ðŸš‡ Capstone"

    :material-file: [**PM2.5 in NYC Subway System: Air Quality Analysis**](capstone.md)

    - **Focus:** Measuring underground air pollution in NYC subway lines using low-cost sensors.
    - **Devices:** PurpleAir, UPAS, Temptop.
    - **Findings:**
        - Average PM2.5 = 105 Âµg/mÂ³ (vs. 6.55 Âµg/mÂ³ outdoors).
        - Many stations exceed EPA 24-hr standard (35 Âµg/mÂ³).
        - Commuters and workers face significant health risks.
    - **Recommendation:** Build a sensor network and revise ventilation policy.

=== "ðŸš° WCI"

    :material-file: [**Water Confidence Index (WCI)**](wci.md)

    - **Focus:** A composite index ranking U.S. public water systems on compliance and reporting transparency.
    - **Method:** EPA SDWIS/ECHO data (2011â€“2020), normalized into Environmental Compliance + Truthful Reporting scores.
    - **Top States:** Indiana, Minnesota, Michigan
    - **Bottom States:** Texas, California, Mississippi
    - **Applications:** Infrastructure funding prioritization, public trust, environmental justice.

=== "ðŸŒŠ Wetland"

    :material-file: [**Coastal Wetland Eutrophication (Gulf Coast)**](wetland.md)

    - **Focus:** Evaluating how wetlands vs. urbanized coasts impact harmful algal blooms (HABs).
    - **Method:** MODIS-Aqua (2005â€“2020) and Landsat 8 chlorophyll-a anomaly analysis.
    - **Findings:**
        - Wetlands reduced bloom severity by ~14% in high-bloom years.
        - Urban areas showed higher chlorophyll and nutrient loading.
    - **Implication:** Coastal wetland restoration can mitigate eutrophication and climate risk.

=== "ðŸŒ³ Natural Capital"

    :material-file: [**Breaking the Carbon Budget: Accounting for Natural Capital**](natural_capital.md)

    - **Focus:** Redefining economic development by valuing natural capital and reallocating the global carbon budget.
    - **Themes:** Paris Agreement compliance, natural vs. human capital, equity in emissions reductions.
    - **Key Insights:**
        - Natural capital accounts for nearly 50% of wealth in low-income nations.
        - Few countries (e.g., Morocco, The Gambia) align with 1.5Â°C targets.
        - Policy must shift from short-term growth to ecosystem investment and capital rebalancing.
